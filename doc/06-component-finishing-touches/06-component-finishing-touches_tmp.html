<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>By now, you should have an entire component implemented at all levels. For
example, you should have two interfaces, an abstract class, and a kernel
implementation.</p>
<p>Now, we want you to start producing your actual portfolio. To do that, you
need to do a few things first:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You need to add testing</strong>: tests can be written basically as soon as you
have designed your interfaces. Of course, because of how many changes your
design has probably had up to this point, writing tests that early may lead
to a lot of rework. Therefore, there is no better time to start testing than
now that you have something more concrete.</li>
<li><strong>You need to share some use cases</strong>: while having an API is useful, it's
not always clear how and why someone would use it. Therefore, you should
probably replicate some of the proof-of-concept work you did previously
using your complete component.</li>
<li><strong>You need to publish your work</strong>: if you haven't yet already, now would
be a good time to publish your component to a public repo like GitHub.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the three main tasks we want you to complete to round out your
portfolio project. However, there are tons of ways to take your work to the next
level, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Publish your documentation</strong>: one of the perks of using JUnit is that you
can directly convert all those comments you made in your code to HTML
files that can be hosted as Java documentation. How do you think the OSU
API works?</li>
<li><strong>Start a CI pipeline</strong>: it's very likely that you won't touch your component
again after this class. That said, maybe you want to actual publish your
component to a dependency manager like Maven. If so, it's a good idea to
setup some automated testing and deployment through &quot;Continuous Integration.&quot;
GitHub Actions is a common tool for this, so why not look into it?</li>
<li><strong>Track version history</strong>: in the world of software development, it's very
important that you version your API with a version number. There are many
different techniques for versioning software, but a date-based system is
pretty easy. If you release your component on a particular date, use that
date as the version number. Alternatively, you can make use of other
techniques like semantic versioning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these additional techniques are somewhat out of the scope of this
course, but just knowing about them could set you up for long term success.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-checklist">Assignment Checklist</h2>
<!-- TODO: browse the checklist then delete this comment -->
<p>To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the <code>settings.json</code> file:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-string">"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
</div></code></pre>
<p>Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-string">"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree"</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
</div></code></pre>
<h2 id="assignment-learning-objectives">Assignment Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design a test plan for a software sequence component</li>
<li>Provide example use cases of a software sequence component</li>
<li>Use version control software to share a repository of code</li>
<li>Reflect on the software development process and the individual's own growth</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-rubric">Assignment Rubric</h2>
<p>Unlike previous parts of the portfolio project, in this part of the project,
you'll receive a summative assessment, which usually involves a more critical
lens. In other words, at this stage, we're expecting you to demonstrate some
mastery of the material. See the rubric items for specifics.</p>
<ol>
<li>(15 points) All component methods must be tested including the Standard,
kernel, and secondary methods. The format of testing will be different from
the style used in the course because it is unlikely that you will have an
existing component to test against (more on this below).</li>
<li>(10 points) There must be at least two different sample codes provided that
show how the component might be used. For example, consider how <code>XMLTree</code>
was used to create the <code>RSSReader</code> and the <code>RSSAggregator</code>. There is no
expectation that you provide samples to this much depth, but two files
with at least a main method would be excellent.</li>
<li>(15 points) As you work through these finishing touches, take a moment to
reflect on the software development process. There are reflection prompts
below. You should also reflect on your growth as a developer and share
details about what you've learned.</li>
<li>(10 points) The overall component must exhibit a high level of polish.
Because all previous parts of this assignment are meant to be formative,
assessments were generally charitable. In this phase, you should submit
a component as if you were a professional software engineer. Follow good
practices like using good variable names, documenting your methods, and
overall adhering to the discipline.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pre-assignment-tasks">Pre-Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>To finish your component, make a branch off of main in your new repo called
something like <code>finishing-touches</code>. There are many ways to do this, but my
preference is to use GitHub Desktop. From there, you can click the <code>Branch</code>
tab, select <code>New branch</code>, and name your new branch. Alternatively, VSCode has
its own GUI for git. You can also make use of the command line directly in
VSCode to run git commands. It's entirely up to you. Regardless of your choice,
we'll want a branch that you can later make a pull request from with all
your changes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: because you may have changes still sitting in a pull request,
you'll want to make this new branch directly from main. This may seem weird
because you won't be able to see the other parts (e.g., your proof of concept)
in VSCode. This is okay as parts 1-5 can be executed in isolation and merged
together later. However, this does mean that you may be waiting for a pull
request to see if your different features fit together. Once the pull request
merges, you will need to pull the changes from main into your current branch
to see them. If you don't like this workflow, you may try following the
rebase strategies described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35790561/working-while-waiting-for-pending-pr">here</a>
and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18021888/continue-working-on-a-git-branch-after-making-a-pull-request">here</a>.</p>
<!-- TODO: make a new branch from main then delete this comment -->
<h2 id="assignment-tasks">Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>Your primary task for this assignment is to polish up your code and get it
ready to publish. To do that, you are being tasked with testing all of your
existing code. You are also being tasked with coming up with at least two
samples of your component being used for something. When all is said and done,
you will publish your component to an open-source repository of your choosing.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>As a part of testing your code, you will need to create a couple test files
in the <code>test</code> directory. One of the files will be the JUnit test file for the
kernel. Meanwhile, the other file will be the JUnit test file for the abstract
class.</p>
<p>Unlike throughout the semester, testing will not involve testing against
a reference implementation. As a result, testing is a bit messier and will
involve calling kernel methods to check state. For example, here is a test
case for one of the getters in NaturalNumber:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">testIsZero</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    NaturalNumber n = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> NaturalNumber1L();
    assertEquals(<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>, n.isZero());
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>Note that this kind of testing is not as effective as the reference testing
because it doesn't verify the entirety of the number's state. For example,
it's possible that <code>n.isZero()</code> somehow changes the state of <code>n</code>. By only
verifying the boolean value, there's no way of knowing if the remaining
number is still intact. Therefore, it's probably better to write a test
as follows:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-meta">@Test</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">testGetXOne</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    NaturalNumber n = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> NaturalNumber1L();
    NaturalNumber nCopy = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> NaturalNumber1L();
    assertEquals(<span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>, n.isZero());
    assertEquals(nCopy, n);
}
</div></code></pre>
<p>At least that way, you know the number is unchanged (i.e., <code>isZero()</code> properly
restored <code>n</code>).</p>
<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>Another requirement to finish the project is to provide a couple of use cases
for your component. To do that, the only expectation is that you generate
two Java files in <code>src</code> with example code using your component either as part of
the representation of some other proof-of-concept component or directly in
<code>main</code>. For instance, the following class would be a extremely minimal example
of how NaturalNumber might be used as part of a representation:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">WholeNumber</span> </span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> NaturalNumber n;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">WholeNumber</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> n)</span> </span>{
       <span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> n &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">0</span> : <span class="hljs-string">"Violation of: n &gt;= 0"</span>;
       <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.n = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> NaturalNumber1L(n);
    }

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">countUp</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
       <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.n.increment();
    }
}
</div></code></pre>
<h3 id="polish">Polish</h3>
<p>Overall polish involves a variety of efforts to demonstrate code quality.
One of which would be directory structure. As an example, I would recommend
that your directories look as follows before submission:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>│   .gitattributes

</div></code></pre>
<p>In addition, you'll want to take into account everything you've learned over
the last two semesters to ensure your code is of good quality. That includes
but is not limited to documenting your methods with parameter modes, giving your
variables good names, making good use of whitespace, respecting CheckStyle, and
just generally not taking shortcuts. Ultimately, you should be incorporating
the feedback you've received throughout this process into your final product.
<strong>Have some pride in your work!</strong></p>
<h2 id="post-assignment-tasks">Post-Assignment Tasks</h2>
<p>The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Now that you have created a software component from scratch, it's time to
reflect on that process as well as take some time to think about your
growth as a developer. Below, you will find a series of reflection prompts.
Take some time to fill them out honestly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common gripe that students express is how much they feel the work they do
in class fails to map to the real world. Now that you've had a chance to
complete the portfolio project, how much better (or worse) do you think you
understand software development and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: discuss -->
<blockquote>
<p>Also, did the portfolio project surface any gaps in your own knowledge of
software development. If so, what are those gaps and how did you address them?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: discuss -->
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, as a part of completing the portfolio project, to what extent has
your perspective of software development changed, if at all? In other words,
is software development something you still enjoy? If not, why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: discuss -->
<blockquote>
<p>One of the challenges of completing the portfolio project is picking up a lot
of skills on your own. Some of these skills are, of course, software skills.
However, there are plenty of other skills you may have picked up through
this process. Therefore, the first question is what skills did you pick up
through this process?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: discuss -->
<blockquote>
<p>The follow-up question is: could you rephrase these skills you picked up
as bullet points that you could put on a resume? Try it below.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: discuss -->
<blockquote>
<p>Next, how has working on this project affected your career trajectory?
In other words, do you now hate the topic you picked? Or, are you even more
interested in it? Both outcomes are valuable to your personal development.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- TODO: discuss -->

<!-- TODO: discuss -->
<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>
<!-- TODO: update CHANGELOG then delete this comment -->
<p>At the end of every assignment, you should update the
<a href="../../CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG.md</a> file found in the root of the project folder.
Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-section"># Changelog</span>

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [<span class="hljs-string">Keep a Changelog</span>](<span class="hljs-link">https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/</span>),
and this project adheres to [<span class="hljs-string">Calendar Versioning</span>](<span class="hljs-link">https://calver.org/</span>) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

<span class="hljs-section">## YYYY.MM.DD</span>

<span class="hljs-section">### Added</span>
<span class="hljs-bullet">
- </span>Designed test suite for <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- insert name of component here --&gt;</span></span> component
<span class="hljs-bullet">- </span>Designed two different use cases for <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- insert name of component here --&gt;</span></span> component

<span class="hljs-section">### Updated</span>
<span class="hljs-bullet">
- </span>Changed design to include ...

</div></code></pre>
<p>Here <code>YYYY.MM.DD</code> would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.</p>
<p>You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<!-- TODO: read the submission instructions then delete this comment -->
<p>Assuming that your project is in a GitHub repo somewhere and your changes are on
a proof-of-concept branch, then what we'll want you to do is create a pull
request of all your changes. Pull requests are pretty easy to make if you're
using GitHub Desktop. Just click the <code>Branch</code> tab and select
<code>Create pull request</code>. This should pull up your browser with the pull request
form ready to complete. Give your pull request a good title like &quot;Completed Part
6 of the Portfolio Project&quot; and briefly describe what you've done. Then, click
&quot;Create pull request&quot;.</p>
<p>If all goes well, you should have a pull request that you can submit to Carmen
via its URL. The URL should be in the form:
<code>https://github.com/username/repo-name/pull/#</code></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: you are the owner of the repo, so you are not required to wait for
feedback before merging. After all, the main purpose of the pull request is to
put all your changes in once place for a code review. However, I highly
recommend keeping the pull request open until at least a peer has had a chance
to look over your changes. Otherwise, you defer needed changes to later pull
requests, which could sacrifice the overall quality of your work or result in
major rework.</p>
<h3 id="peer-review">Peer Review</h3>
<p>Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component abstract classes for review. Please do not spend a ton of
time on your reviews, <strong>perhaps 10-15 minutes each</strong>. Your job during the peer
review process is to help your peers work through the logic of their implementations
and identify gaps in their use of design-by-contract (i.e., forgetting checks
for preconditions). If something seems wrong to you, it's probably a good hunch,
so make sure to point it out.</p>
<p>When reviewing your peers' assignments, please treat them with respect. We
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Criteria of Constructive Feedback</th>
<th>Missing</th>
<th>Developing</th>
<th>Meeting</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Specific</td>
<td>All feedback is general (not specific)</td>
<td>Some (but not all) feedback is specific and some examples may be provided.</td>
<td>All feedback is specific, with examples provided where possible</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actionable</td>
<td>None of the feedback provides actionable items or suggestions for improvement</td>
<td>Some feedback provides suggestions for improvement, while some do not</td>
<td>All (or nearly all) feedback is actionable; most criticisms are followed by suggestions for improvement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prioritized</td>
<td>Feedback provides only major or minor concerns, but not both. Major and minar concerns are not labeled or feedback is unorganized</td>
<td>Feedback provides both major and minor concerns, but it is not clear which is which and/or the feedback is not as well organized as it could be</td>
<td>Feedback clearly labels major and minor concerns. Feedback is organized in a way that allows the reader to easily understand which points to prioritize in a revision</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balanced</td>
<td>Feedback describes either strengths or areas of improvement, but not both</td>
<td>Feedback describes both strengths and areas for improvement, but it is more heavily weighted towards one or the other, and/or descusses both but does not clearly identify which part of the feedback is a strength/area for improvement</td>
<td>Feedback provides balanced discussion of the document's strengths and areas for improvement. It is clear which piece of feedback is which</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tactful</td>
<td>Overall tone and language are not appropriate (e.g., not considerate, could be interpreted as personal criticism or attack)</td>
<td>Overall feedback tone and language are general positive, tactul, and non-threatening, but one or more feedback comments could be interpretted as not tactful and/or feedback leans toward personal criticism, not focused on the document</td>
<td>Feedback tone and language are positive, tactful, and non-threatening. Feedback addesses the document, not the writer</td>
